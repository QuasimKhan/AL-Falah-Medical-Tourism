      content: `
Cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow and divide uncontrollably, destroying healthy body tissue.  
- Normally, cells grow, divide, and die in a controlled cycle.  
- In cancer, this cycle is disrupted — old cells don't die, and new cells form unnecessarily.  
- Cancer can begin **anywhere in the body**, which is made up of millions of cells.
